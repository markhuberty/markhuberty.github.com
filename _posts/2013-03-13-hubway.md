title: Where do bikes take us together? 
---

Back in December, the [Hubway Data Challenge](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/) released data on Boston's Hubway bikeshare and asked people to do interesting stuff with it. The winning entries explored [how much time Hubway saved](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/submission/45/) Bostonians, [how bikes flowed through](http://zsobhani.github.com/hubway-team-viz) the Hubway system, and [how Boston's relationship](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/submission/56/) with Hubway evolved over half a million trips. 

I wanted to ask a different question: how often do people go places together, where do they go, and do these trips differ from the rest of Hubway uses? 

To identify people traveling with a companion, I assumed that two trips that left from the same station at the same time, and arrived at the same station at the same time, were taken together. Of course, it could just be coincidence. But then it might also have been the start of a plot for a bad rom-com. 

With that assumption, 61,430 trips of the 552,030 trips in the dataset were taken with someone else. Here's what we know about them.


### People who travel together are closer in age

Traveling companions differed in age by a median 2 years, compared with 9 years for a random pair of solo Hubway travelers.

### Companions favor the weekends

### Companions left later...

Readers paying close attention will also notice that companions were more likely to ride around very late at night. Post-night-out bike ride, anyone?

### ...And rode slower

### They also likely had more fun

- Most popular stations for pairs: Arlington/Boyleston, at the corner of [Boston Common](http://www.cityofboston.gov/freedomtrail/bostoncommon.asp)
- Most popular stations for solo travelers: [South Station](http://www.south-station.net/) commuter hub

## Bicycles, Boston, and Companionship

One big assumption later, it seems bicycles might be more than just tools of transportation. If bike share programs not only bring Bostonians to their destinations, but also brought them together, that can't be a bad thing.
