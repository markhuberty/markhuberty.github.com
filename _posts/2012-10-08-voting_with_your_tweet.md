title: Rinline for sparse matrix scalar multiplication

My [paper](http://markhuberty.berkeley.edu/files/twitter_paper.pdf.zip) on electoral prediction with Twitter suggested that it might be possible to accurately forecast US House of Representatives collections using Twitter mentions of the candidates. 

For 2012, I'm generating real-time predictions and publishing them [here](http://californianewsservice.org/category/tweet-vote/). More information on the algorithms and methods used to generate these outputs can be found at my [Github](https://github.com/markhuberty/).
