Research overview
-----------------

My research focuses on three inter-related problems in political
economy:

-   The political economy of climate and energy policy
-   The political economy of innovation and change in advanced
    industrial societies
-   Potential applications of machine learning and computational methods
    in these areas

### Dissertation

My dissertation asks why anyone has succeeded at doing anything at all
to combat climate change. The combination of radical technological
change, large costs, and distant and diffuse benefits, should make the
politics of climate policy intractable. But we see a variety of
activity--in Europe, in some U.S. states, and elsewhere.

I show that policymakers have succeeded by yoking support for climate
change to tangible benefits created by transforming today's fossil
fuel-based energy systems. Renewable energy itself offers few obvious
improvements over fossil fuels. But adopting it may require other
changes--to the power grid, or energy markets, or industrial
structure--that make us better off immediately. Delivering these
benefits can help generate support for policy, and insulate it from
attacks by those who'd prefer inaction. Hence successful climate
policy won't look like some "optimal" carbon price. Instead, we should
expect messy, perhaps circuitous, but ultimately politically stable
industrial policies to prevail.
