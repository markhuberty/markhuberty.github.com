		  <h4>Computational tools for political science</h4>
		  <p>I designed and taught PS239T in Fall 2009. It
		  was intended to provided first-year Political
		  Science graduate students with a background in
		  R, LaTeX, and Emacs before they began the
		  statistical methods sequence. </p>
		  <p>I've had a number of requests for
		  the slides from that course. They are
		  available as a zip file <a
		  href="./files/PS239T_Lectures_F09.zip"
		   >here</a>. The course readings (the free
		  ones, at least), are available <a href="./files/PS239T_Readings_F09.zip" >here</a>.</p>

		    <h3 class="title">PS191 Spring 2012</h3>
		    <h4>The political economy of climate and energy</h4>
		    <p>This course examined economic and technological challenges of emissions reduction, and their implications for domestic and international political economy. Students examined the historic processes that led to the adoption of todayâ€™s fossil fuel energy systems; the economic and political institutions that frame those systems; and the technical, economic, and political difficulties in changing them. Students also analyzed the political implications of more radical solutions to the emissions problem, including geoengineering and green growth. Co-taught with Prof. John Zysman. A full syllabus is available <a href="./files/ps191_syllabus_s2012.pdf">here</a></p>
