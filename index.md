### Welcome

<p>
  I am a student of economic and political systems with a deep
  interest in using new and novel data to study economic and political
  systems. I will finish my Ph.D. in political science at
  <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> in June 2013,
  and am seeking employment in data science and analytics in the Bay Area.
</p>

### Background
  In my research, I've worked on a range of projects at the
  intersection of computational social science, economics, and
  politics. In 2012, I issued <a href="http://californianewsservice.org/category/tweet-vote/">real-time election
  predictions</a> based on Twitter data. To study European climate and
  energy policy, I built <a href="./leghist.html">tools</a> to track
  legislative influence on climate and energy legislation through text
  mining and topic modeling. I'm currently engaged in an ongoing
  project to <a href="https://github.com/markhuberty/psClean">clean</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/markhuberty/dedupe">disambiguate</a>
  huge patent databases using semi-supervised machine
  learning. Through these projects I've built a broad set of skills in
  <a href="http://r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a>, <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">pandas</a>,
  and data visualization.

I've
also <a href="publications.html">written extensively</a> on the economic and political implications
of "green growth"--the idea that climate change investments will
save our environment and make us richer at the same time.
